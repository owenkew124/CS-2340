M5 Testing Process

testGetTargetsArray() - Checks that the getTargets() method returns an ArrayList of TileObjects. For our combat system, the towers call this method to find which enemies to act on.

testFireNullTower() - Checks that a null tower cannot be fired. This test is important to ensure no errors

testCombatControllerIncrementMoney() - Checks that the combat controller increments money on the correct interval.

testCombatControllerDoesNotIncrementMoney() - Checks that the combat controller does not increment money when the time is not correct.

testCombatControllerNewEnemy() - Checks that the combat controller creates a new enemy on the correct interval.

testInteractNullTowerAndTarget() - Checks that interact() cannot be completed with a null tower and null target. This method handles combat between a tower and target and must be able to handle null parameters.

testDeleteNullEnemy() - Checks that deleting a null enemy cannot be completed. This scenario should never occur, but the method must be able to handle it.

testProcessNoEnemy() - Checks that no methods are called when there are no enemies and the game processes the enemies

testCheckUserTryingToMinePath() - Checks that the system is alerted when a user tries to mine the path.

testSetupMap() - Checks that the map is setup when the method is called.
